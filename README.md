A person quizzing oneself on a new skill has long proved an effective way to cement ones understanding of new information.  It is with this in mind that I have built a basic javascript test.  The test covers four basic questions, but could easily have many more added to it thanks to its dynamically generated questions and answer buttons taken directly from the quiz bank.  When the participant clicks the start button, a timer begins.  A right answer will move to the next question, while a wrong answer will deduct 10 seconds before moving on.  The total seconds left at the end represent the player's score.  The player may enter their initials upon completing the quiz and have it display onscreen along with their score.

## Technology used
This quiz utilizes extensive use of javascript, CSS styling from Bootstrap, and basic HTML elements.

This quiz will aid students in reviewing basic concepts of Javascript to help further their understanding of programing.
